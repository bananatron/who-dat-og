<b>WHO DAT</b> is a game to help folks recognize one another while a company grows.
Made during a Hired.com hackathon.

#TODO
- Make play fade in to avoid weird jump on first reflow
- Optimize mobile view
- Additional companies?
    All (or at least most) of the back-end functions aren't hard-coding hired as the 
    solo organization so extensibility to allow other companies to use would be 
    relatively easy and might be somewhat valuable as a promotional tool.
- Front-end cleanup 
    Front-end was made hastily and as a result the view/css code isn't great
- Javascript cleanup
    Right now each page has scripts baked into their respective views. This isn't ideal.
- Make leaderboards look better/more scalable
